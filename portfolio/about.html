    <h1>About me</h1>

    <div class="flex">
      <p>
        My name is Tudor and currently I'm a student at Menlo School and play for the Menlo Tennis Varsity Team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've played Tennis since I was 6 years old. I started playing in Romania in a small club,
        before I moved to Germany and played at a bigger club, and I played tournaments all over Germany ultimately
        getting a sponsorship from Wilson.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year I moved to the US and switched to a new surface: hard-court.
        In the US, I play tournaments with my Highschool Team, but also travel indivually throughout the US.<br />
        I usually practice 10 hours a week at the Eagle Fustar Academy in Sunnyvale.<br />
        For those of you who are interested: I also give tennis lessons to young people to guide them through their
        tennis careers.
